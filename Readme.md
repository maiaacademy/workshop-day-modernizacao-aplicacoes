## Project #1.1 - Web Application Modernization (30 minutes)

### Setting up Azure Migrate

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your lab resource group. Select **Create** to add a new resource.

2. On the Create a resource screen, search for **Azure Migrate** and select it from the list of suggestions.

3. Select **Create** to continue.

4. As part of our migration project for Parts Unlimited, we will first assess and migrate their Web Application living on IIS, on a VM. Select **Web Apps** to continue.

5. Select **Create project**.

6. Type **partsunlimitedweb** as your project name. Select **Create** to continue.

7. Once your project is created **Azure Migrate** will show you default **Web App Assessment** and **Web App Migration** tools (You might need to refresh your browser). For the Parts Unlimited web site, **App Service Migration Assistant** is the one we have to use. Download links are presented on Azure Migrate's Web Apps page. In our case, our lab environment comes with App Service Migration Assistant pre-installed on Parts Unlimited's web server.

8. Another aspect of our migration project will be the database for Parts Unlimited's website. We will have to assess the database's compatibility and migrate to Azure SQL Database. Let's switch to the **SQL Server (only)** section in Azure Migrate. Select **Click here** hyperlink for Assessment tools.

9. We will use **Azure Migrate: Database Assessment** to assess Parts Unlimited's database hosted on a SQL Server 2008 R2 server. Pick **Azure Migrate: Database Assessment (1)** and select **Add tool (2)**.

10. **This step is for informational purposes only.**  Now, we can see a download link for the **Data Migration Assessment (1)** tool under assessment tools in Azure Migrate. In our case, our lab environment comes with the Data Migration Assessment pre-installed on Parts Unlimited's database server. Select **Click here (2)** under the **Migration Tools** section to continue.

11. We will use **Azure Migrate: Database Migration** to migrate Parts Unlimited's database to an Azure SQL Database. Pick **Azure Migrate: Database Assessment (1)** and select **Add tool (2)**.

12. Now, we have all the assessment and migration tools/services we need for Parts Unlimited ready to go under the Azure Migrate umbrella.

### Migrate Application with App Service Migration Assistant

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **WebVM** VM by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list, selecting the **PartsUnlimited** resource group, and selecting the **WebVM** VM from the list of resources.

2. Go back to the Azure Portal. On the WebVM Virtual Machine's **Overview** blade, select **Connect (1)** and **RDP (2)** on the top menu.

3. Select **Download RDP File** on the next page, and open the downloaded file.

    > **Note**: The first time you connect to the WebVM Virtual Machine, you will see a blue pop-up terminal dialog taking you through a couple of software installs. Don't be alarmed, and wait until the installs are complete.

4. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

5. Enter the following credentials with your password when prompted, and then select **OK**:

   - **Username**: demouser
   - **Password**: {YOUR-ADMIN-PASSWORD}

    > **Note**: default password is `Password.1!!`

6. Select **Yes** to connect, if prompted that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

7. Once logged into the WebVM VM, a script will execute to install the various items needed for the remaining lab steps.
    >**Warning:** You must wait for all of the scripts to finish installing and configuring the software when you first log in. DO NOT shutdown the PowerShell script.  The PowerShell script creates the database and seeds the tables with data. Failing to wait for the script to complete will prevent you from finishing the rest of the lab.

8. Once the PowerSell script has completed, the web server should be configured now. Return to the Azure Portal, on the WebVM Virtual Machine's **Overview (1)** blade, copy the **Public IP address (2)**.

9. Open a new browser window and navigate to the IP Address you copied.

    >**Note:** If you cannot see the web page properly display, then your web server configuration may be incorrect.

10. Once the script completes, open **AppServiceMigrationAssistant** that is located on the desktop.

11. Once App Service Migration Assistant discovers the websites available on the server, choose **Default Web Site (1)** for migration and select **Next (2)** to start the assessment.

12. Observe the result of the assessment report. In our case, our application has successfully passed 13 tests **(1)** with no additional actions needed. Now that our assessment is complete, select **Next (2)** to proceed to the migration.

   > For the details of the readiness checks, see [App Service Migration Assistant documentation](https://github.com/Azure/App-Service-Migration-Assistant/wiki/Readiness-Checks).

#### Migrate the Web application to Azure App Service

1. In order to continue with the migration of our website Azure App Service Migration Assistant needs access to our Azure Subscription. Select **Copy Code & Open Browser** button to be redirected to the Azure Portal.

4. Continue the login process with your Azure Subscription credentials. When you see the message that says **You have signed in to the Azure App Service Migration Assistant application on your device** close the browser window and return to the App Service Migration Assistant.

5. Select the Azure Migrate project we created **(1)** in the previous exercise to submit our migration results. Select **Next** to continue.
    >**Note:** If you do not see your Azure Migrate Project, you may have switch user directory (subscriptions) to the directory where the project was created.

6. In order to migrate Parts Unlimited website, we have to create an App Service Plan. The Azure App Service Migration Assistant will take care of all the requirements needed. Select **Use existing (1)** and select the lab resource group as your deployment target. App Service requires a globally unique Site Name. We suggest using a pattern that matches `partsunlimited-web-{uniquesuffix}` **(2)**. Select **Migrate** to start the migration process.

7. Verify your migration. Select **Go to your website**.

    > **Warning:** If your migration fails with a **WindowsWorkersNotAllowedInLinuxResourceGroup (1)** try the migration process again, but this time selecting a different Resource Group for your deployment. If that is not possible, select a different Region.  

8. We have just completed the Parts Unlimited website's migration from IIS on a Virtual Machine to Azure App Service. Congratulations. Let's go back to the Azure Portal and look into Azure Migrate. Search for `migrate` **(1)** on the Azure Portal and select **Azure Migrate (2)**.

9. Verify your migrations.
    - Select the **Web Apps** section. View the number of discovered web servers, assessed websites.
    - Select the **Refresh** button.
    - View the assessed and migrated websites. Keep in mind that you might need to wait for 5 to 10 minutes for results to show up.
